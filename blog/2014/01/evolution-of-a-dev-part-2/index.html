          <h2>Evolution of a Dev (Part 2)
          </h2>
        </header>
        <section><p>When we <a href="evolution-of-a-dev-part-1/">last left</a> our hero (me), he was basking
in the wonderment that is pure software development.  &quot;I wanna go do this fo realz!&quot;
So I set about finding a new job, one that would allow me to throw off the shackles
of ops and focus solely on writing code.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, I didn&#39;t have to spend very long looking.  All it took was moving
300 miles away from everything I had ever known, with a wife and our 2 children 
in tow.  An easy decision for me, and since I&#39;m a pretty good salesman as well,
they followed with little resistance.</p>
<p>I accepted a position as an RPG IV programmer (because that&#39;s still where my
only real professional experience lie) and learned what it meant to do real
programming work for a real product that was to be purchased by real customers.
And I hated it.  It was boring.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well, that&#39;s not entirely fair.  Some of the problems we had to solve were
quite complex, and the solutions were sometimes ingenious.  But all in all,
it wasn&#39;t quite as fulfilling as I had hoped.  In hindsight, however, this was
a good thing.  I was getting paid to write code.  While it might not have been
exactly what I had expected, it was still better than any of the alternative
means of supporting myself I could think of.  Major lesson: every programming session
isn&#39;t a rock-star moment.</p>
<p>On the brighter side, I discovered that I was actually pretty good at it.  In
some ways, I was slightly better than the others, who were in some cases twice
my age.  This is where I started to lose some humility, which again, might sound
like a bad thing, but will come into play later on.</p>
<p>There was also a group within the shop devoted to PC and mobile device development.
No, we&#39;re not talking iPad&#39;s and smartphones here.  This was old-school 5250 emulation
on warehouse barcode scanners.  We&#39;re talking C, Java, and TCL.  I love C.  I mean, I
love it.  I hear people say you should use the best tool for the job, but I still think
that, from a puritanical point of view, C is that tool.  For every job.  But I digress.</p>
<p>I befriended the manager of PC development and he sort of took me under his wing.  I
say sort of, because he was a windows guy, and I was predominantly Linux.  So there
was a bit of a language barrier of sorts (ipconfig vs. ifconfig, etc).  Nevertheless,
he introduced me to real-world development of complex systems using software.
The term he used was &quot;architecture&quot;, and I&#39;ve been obsessed with it ever since.</p>
<p>When he decided to move on, I was offered his position as manager.  Given I had little
humility (see above), I obviously accepted.  I figured I was the best dev in the shop,
regardless of the platform or language.  No big deal.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong.  Managing developers and being a developer almost require entirely
different skillsets.  I was not horrible at the job, per se, but I did realize it
was an either/or proposition.  Either I was one of them, or I was above them.  You
can&#39;t be both.  Anyone who has tried to make that transition knows what I mean.</p>
<p>Then there was the administration side of things.  Interfacing with upper management
was extremelty frustrating, because they didn&#39;t care about the code, only the bottom
line.  Results, no matter how much had to be sacrificed, were all that mattered.
I found myself agreeing to things as a manager that my developer side would have
given the middle finger to.</p>
<p>Over time, I started to realize that it wasn&#39;t quite as bad as my naive self wanted to
believe.  Business pays the bills.  Paying customers allow us devs to do
the things we love, even if there are limits.  I&#39;d say this was when I entered my
teenage years as a budding software engineer.  Next time, <a href="../evolution-of-a-dev-part-3">I hop on the startup train</a>, and 
experience development in its purest form.</p>
