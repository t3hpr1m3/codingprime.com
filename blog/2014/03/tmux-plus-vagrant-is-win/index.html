          <h2>Tmux + Vagrant = win!
          </h2>

        <section><p>In my quest to <a href="../02/adapting-to-mac/">become one with my Air</a>, I&#39;ve been in
search of the best tooling to keep my workflow smooth.  I did some playing
around with MacVim, running rbenv in OSX, and various IRC clients.  After
a lot of hand-wringing and head-scratching, I think I&#39;ve come up with the
best solution.</p>
<h3 id="cheaters-always-win-">Cheaters always win!</h3>
<p>My fix is to give up and give in.  <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to
the rescue!  In all fairness, the choice to use Vagrant was sort of a team
decision.  We have quite a few devs, and find a way for them to work
consistently seems like the perfect use case for Vagrant.  So for
day-to-day work, I spin up the project specific VM using the Vagrantfile in
the repo, then just pull in <a href="https://github.com/t3hpr1m3/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
using <a href="https://github.com/andsens/homeshick">homeshick</a>.  This workflow
allows me to always work in a consistent environment, no matter where I&#39;m
working from (even from a Putty session).</p>

<h3 id="gui-gotta-go-">GUI Gotta Go!</h3>
<p>In my quest to find the ultimate dev environment, I decided that, optimally,
I should only need 2 windows open at any given time: a terminal and a browser.
In order to accomplish this, I had to find console based replacements for
everything I currently had gui apps for.  This list included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colloquy (IRC)</li>
<li>Mail (duh)</li>
<li>Pandora (yeah, I&#39;m one of those people)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://irssi.org/">Irssi</a> filled the first need nicely, as I&#39;ve used it
extensively in the past.  I should have been using it anyway.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> took care of mail.  I still have Gmail running
in a browser window for complicated attachments and alternate accounts, but
Mutt is my primary mail reader, and it works great.</p>
<p>Pandora was a little harder, but I was finally able to get
<a href="http://6xq.net/projects/pianobar/">pianobar</a> working, and working well.  I was
finally ready to commit to using the terminal to handle everything.  The
problem was visibility.  Constantly switching tabs to check email or skip a
song was becoming a huge chore.  There had to be a better way.  Then I remembered
multiplexers.</p>
<h3 id="tmux-is-the-new-screen">Tmux is the new screen</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve been using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> for years to
crank up long-running processes on servers, so my terminal wasn&#39;t tied up 
waiting for some 12 hour database rebuild to finish, only for the connection
to drop at 99.7%, forcing me to start the whole thing over again.  I had also
used it to do some quick and dirty pair programming, but nothing fancy.</p>
<p>I rediscovered <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>, pushed through the initial
pain of learning something new, and found the awesomeness that is true
multiplexing.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/4helvtT.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4helvtT.png" alt="Tmux is AWESOME!"></a></p>
<p>It took some getting used to, and my setup would require a post all on its own,
but I&#39;m back to being productive again.</p>
