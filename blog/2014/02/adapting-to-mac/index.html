        <section><p>I am a Linux guy.  Ever since my first install of RedHat 5.1, I&#39;ve been hooked.
My home router/firewall is a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo box</a>, ffs.  For
servers, I&#39;ve migrated from <a href="http://vpslink.com">VPSLink</a> to
<a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a>, with a few one off droplets on
<a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>.  There isn&#39;t a machine in my
house that doesn&#39;t at least dual-boot Linux.</p>
<p>For the last few years, my primary dev box has been my <a href="http://www.asus.com/ROG_ROG/G74SX/">ASUS behemoth</a>.
It&#39;s nowhere near an ultrabook, but it was mine.  Mine in the sense that it 
has become an extension of my hands.  It&#39;s heavy, it&#39;s massive, and I love it.</p>
<p>The shop I just joined is pretty much Apple-happy.  Cinema displays, Powerbooks,
Time Capsules, the whole shebang.  On day 1, I was handed a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/SP670">13&quot; MacBook Air</a>.
This thing is everything my ASUS isn&#39;t; small, lightweight, possibly even delicate.
Given that I&#39;ve been using a split keyboard for the last 10 years or so, typing
on this keyboard feels...weird.</p>
<h3 id="when-in-rome">When in Rome</h3>
<p>Given all of the above, I figure the only solution to the problem is to just
go all in, using the MacBook exclusively for everything.  I&#39;m not even going to
use a keyboard or mouse.  I&#39;m just going to use a secondary cinema display for
increased desktop space while in the office.  I want to make sure I give this
machine a fair shake, without going all fanboi with a Magic Mouse and bluetooth
keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="same-but-different">Same, but different</h3>
<p>A few of the features I&#39;ve come to rely on (Expos√©, multiple desktops, quick
application launch) are thankfully present.  iTerm is a decent terminal, and
<a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> works flawlessly.</p>
<p>There are a few oddities, though.  The backspace key is labeled &quot;delete&quot;, and there
is no delete key (<em>fn</em> + delete seems to work).  Also, the <em>control</em>, <em>option</em>,
and <em>command</em> keys are kind of insane.  I&#39;m still not entirely sure what they do,
but I know that <em>command</em> takes the place of <em>ctrl</em> in many operations (cut, copy, etc).</p>
<p>The dock is also a little strange.  Closing windows doesn&#39;t seem to &quot;exit&quot; the
application (it still shows up in the window list when alt+tabbing).</p>
<p>The ssh-agent also seems to be fairly unpredictable.  After a restart, I&#39;m never sure
if it&#39;s active, and I usually don&#39;t find out until I&#39;m trying to commit code
on some remote server.</p>
<p><a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> has helped tremendously.  For someone coming from the
world of package managers, installing from the CLI makes things seem familiar.  I&#39;m
having a hard time resisting the urge to install Gentoo in a VM and do all my
development there.</p>
<h3 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h3>
<p>I plan on giving this at least a month before giving up.  Currently, my biggest
issue is that I actually have to think about what I&#39;m trying to do, which sort
of prevents me from ever getting in the zone.  I&#39;m sure that will get better
with time, so stay tuned.</p>
