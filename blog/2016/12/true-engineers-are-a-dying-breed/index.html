        <section><p>I am a software engineer.  Not a front-end developer.  Not a back-end developer.
Not a <em>full-stack</em> developer (whatever the fuck that means today).  I am an
engineer.  I understand how to devipher technology, figure out how it works, and
build things up using said technology.</p>
<p>If you spend more than 15 minutes lurking around the various tech hangouts these
days, you will undoubtedly come across some bit of tech that smells.  It may
work as advertised, it may not crash your system, but its just...wrong.  When
you go digging into its guts, you find that it's a well polished pile of shit,
put together by some well-intentioned flunkie who wanted to &quot;be somebody&quot; on
the web.</p>

<p>By itself, this isn't really a problem.  Bad software has been around since
software was first invented.  The issue today is that these really bad <em>parts</em>
are being cobbled together into really, really bad <em>apps</em> by developers less
skilled than the original author of the shitty bits.</p>
<p>If this sounds elitist, good.  Chances are, if you're in the software world, I'm
better at whatever you do than you are.  And this isn't because of some innate
gift I possess, or a trip I made to a mountaintop to visit the oracle of <em>teh
codez</em>.  I got this good by making damn sure I understood what I was doing
<em>before</em> I did it.  When I've moved into a new arena (Node.js development, for
instance), I've taken the time to get the lay of the land, determine the
right and wrong ways to implement features, and how best to interact with the
community at large.</p>
<p>More than anything, I make sure I develop my own best-practices, usually
heavily influenced by the opinions of others, and follow them religiously.  I'm
constantly re-evaluating my positions, based on my own experiences as well as
those presented by others.  The key here is <em>evaluating</em>, which requires an
understanding.  I never take anyone's opinion or suggestions at face value.  I
prove them out on my own, making sure there aren't fallacies, or even room for
improvement.  In short, I'm always trying to hone my craft.</p>

<p>I was doing some of the aforementioned research when I came across <a href="https://gist.github.com/markerikson/ead940a93a2a877dc97824e5f839840f">this
gem</a>,
which is apparently a transcript of a conversation between a self-labeled
&quot;front-end&quot; dev and some of the maintainers of the
<a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> packaging tool.  I'm posting this not to
poke fun at &quot;Steven&quot; (if that <em>is</em> in fact your real name?!?), but to hopefully
highlight some of the issues Steven's side of this conversation highlights in
the development community at large.</p>
<p>His issue comes down to a lack of understanding around what he's trying to
accomplish.  He's been getting by with just copying/pasting &quot;solutions&quot; he's
found on SO/Github/HN, and he's finally come up against a problem that doesn't
make any sense to him.  We already have a problem, but it's about to get a lot
better.  When confronted with his ignorance, instead of acknowledging it and
resigning himself to do the requisite research, he lashes out at the webpack
devs for not spoonfeeding him said requisite knowledge in their docs.  Actually,
its worse than that.  He doesn't want the knowledge, he just wants to
short-circuit the learning altogether.  Just give him the what, not the
why.  And this is one of the fundamental issues I see in software
development today.</p>
<p>I've been dabbling in React lately (doing some universal stuff, how sexy!), and
have been dumbfounded by the amount of misinformation present.  I must have
reviewed a dozen or so &quot;boilerplate&quot; repos, and each one seemed to be more
over-engineered than the last.  Rather than stop and try and understand <em>what</em>
they were trying to accomplish, these authors were just trying to throw as many
external resources at a problem until it went away.  If your &quot;boilerplate&quot; has
more than 10 dependencies, it's not boilerplate, sir.</p>
<p>Not taking the time to understand what you're doing is basically your way of
pushing that responsibility off onto somebody else (be it a library author, a
		coworker, or some guy on SO).  I've been around long enough to know that
there are times where this is required due to time constraints, budget, etc.
But if you want to graduate from being just a front-end guy to being a real
engineer, those instances need to be thorns in your side, itches you aren't
comfortable until you can really scratch them.</p>
<p>This has been a bit ranty, but I'm getting old, and I can't help it.  While the
vast array of tooling available today does make the task of carrying out your
day to day duties much less taxing than in years past, at the core of it all,
somebody still has to know how shit works.  If you look around your team and
can't point to anybody who fits that description, take it upon yourself to
step up and be an engineer.</p>
