          <p><p>When we <a href="evolution-of-a-dev-part-1/">last left</a> our hero (me), he was basking
in the wonderment that is pure software development.  &quot;I wanna go do this fo realz!&quot;
So I set about finding a new job, one that would allow me to throw off the shackles
of ops and focus solely on writing code.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, I didn&#39;t have to spend very long looking.  All it took was moving
300 miles away from everything I had ever known, with a wife and our 2 children 
in tow.  An easy decision for me, and since I&#39;m a pretty good salesman as well,
they followed with little resistance.</p>
<p>I accepted a position as an RPG IV programmer (because that&#39;s still where my
only real professional experience lie) and learned what it meant to do real
programming work for a real product that was to be purchased by real customers.
And I hated it.  It was boring.</p></p>

          <p><p>I am a career developer.  That makes me extremely lucky, since I get to earn
a living doing the kind of things I&#39;d be doing anyway.   Basically, I have
the coolest hobby in the world, and I get paid for it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve changed jobs many, many times in my career, and it&#39;s hardly ever been for
the same reasons.  Sometimes (usually), there has been an increase in salary
involved.  Others, it was an opportunity to move into a different environment,
be that technology used, ethos, or a new role to try out.  A few times, it
wasn&#39;t even a choice (early termination due to philosophical differences would
be a kind way of putting it).</p>
<p>Tomorrow, a new challenge awaits, in a new place, with a lot of new faces.
Starting a new job always triggers a bit of reflection (probably because
the process involves reviewing your resume), and this time is no exception.
I know I&#39;m not unique, but that&#39;s kind of the point.  I&#39;ve been around a lot
of devs throughout the course of my career, and (for the most part) it&#39;s fairly
easy to tell where they are in their evolution.</p></p>

          <p><p>My day job consists of architecting and maintaining several Rails
applications.  Some of these must deal with custom data sources that
were architected before there were standards for inter-application
communication (SOAP, REST, XML-RPC, etc).  One in particular is is a custom TCP
server that responds to method calls (using XML as the transport mechanism).
Replacing the service is not an option (as is usually the case with any

          <p><p>Waiting on asset precompilation is a PITA, especially if no assets have been
changed.  Thankfully,
<a href="http://www.bencurtis.com/2011/12/skipping-asset-compilation-with-capistrano/">Ben Curtis</a>
came up with a workable solution.  Except...</p>
<p>Ben&#39;s method fails on the initial deployment, because <em>current_revision</em> tries to
read <em>/path/to/app/current/REVISION</em>, which won&#39;t exist yet.  After trying several
approaches, I have arrived at one which works for me.  There are probably other,
more elegant approaches, but this one seems clear enough for my purposes. 
Posting it here for posterity.</p></p>

          <p><p>I&#39;ve got an app I&#39;m building that is comprised of several engines running in
<em>vendor/nsweb</em>.  I want each engine to have its own specs, without cluttering
up the main app&#39;s <em>spec</em> folder.  I also want to be able to run tests for ALL
engines at once, both using rake and through autotest.  To accomplish the first
task, I added the following:</p>
