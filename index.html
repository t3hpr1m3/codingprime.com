          <p><p>In my quest to <a href="../02/adapting-to-mac/">become one with my Air</a>, I&#39;ve been in
search of the best tooling to keep my workflow smooth.  I did some playing
around with MacVim, running rbenv in OSX, and various IRC clients.  After
a lot of hand-wringing and head-scratching, I think I&#39;ve come up with the
best solution.</p>
<h3 id="cheaters-always-win-">Cheaters always win!</h3>
<p>My fix is to give up and give in.  <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to
the rescue!  In all fairness, the choice to use Vagrant was sort of a team
decision.  We have quite a few devs, and find a way for them to work
consistently seems like the perfect use case for Vagrant.  So for
day-to-day work, I spin up the project specific VM using the Vagrantfile in
the repo, then just pull in <a href="https://github.com/t3hpr1m3/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
using <a href="https://github.com/andsens/homeshick">homeshick</a>.  This workflow
allows me to always work in a consistent environment, no matter where I&#39;m
working from (even from a Putty session).</p></p>

        <section>
          <p><p>I am a Linux guy.  Ever since my first install of RedHat 5.1, I&#39;ve been hooked.
My home router/firewall is a <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo box</a>, ffs.  For
servers, I&#39;ve migrated from <a href="http://vpslink.com">VPSLink</a> to
<a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode</a>, with a few one off droplets on
<a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>.  There isn&#39;t a machine in my
house that doesn&#39;t at least dual-boot Linux.  In fact, I inherited a Mac Mini
when one of the startups I joined closed its doors, and even it runs Linux.</p>
<p>For the last few years, my primary dev box has been my <a href="http://www.asus.com/ROG_ROG/G74SX/">ASUS behemoth</a>.
It&#39;s nowhere near an ultrabook, but it was mine.  Mine in the sense that it 
has become an extension of my hands.  It&#39;s heavy, it&#39;s massive, and I love it.</p></p>

          <p><p>My most recent career stop was also my longest.  With the collapse of my startup dreams,</p>
<p>I had to find employment back in the real world.  I took a position with a local company
that wrote Credit Union software in Delphi (basically Pascal).  The only Delphi I had
ever used was in writing <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">InnoSetup</a> scripts,
so I really had no idea what to expect.  Thankfully, I found out my first day that:</p>
<ol>
<li>They had some server components written in C++, and</li>
<li>They also had a &quot;web&quot; department, which allegedly did internet stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than summarize what I actually DID during my time there, I&#39;ll instead
highlight some of the issues I encountered, my attempts to solve their problems,
and the ultimate reason for my departure.  I won&#39;t address the fact they were
still using Microsoft&#39;s Visual SourceSafe for version control.  I think it speaks for
itself.</p></p>

          <p><p>Recapping the <a href="../evolution-of-a-dev-part-2">last chapter</a>, I&#39;m managing a dev team,
doing a fair bit of C and Java development mixed with some TCL and the occasional
RPG IV.  I&#39;ve gained a bit of arrogance, but also quite a bit of real-world
development experience.  Technically, I&#39;m doing fairly well.  I&#39;ve also been able
to develop some fairly decent team management skills.  Unfortunately, I still 
have a problem with authority.</p>
<p>During a management meeting, I had a difference of opinion (fairly loudly and colorfully)
with the president of the company, and it was decided (surprise!) that my services were no
longer needed.  By this time, I had moved home and been telecommuting for over 2 years,
so logistically this wasn&#39;t as big of a blow as it could have been (thankfully).  This
was, however, the first time I had been unemployeed since I got my first job almost 8 years
prior.</p></p>

          <p><p>When we <a href="evolution-of-a-dev-part-1/">last left</a> our hero (me), he was basking
in the wonderment that is pure software development.  &quot;I wanna go do this fo realz!&quot;
So I set about finding a new job, one that would allow me to throw off the shackles
of ops and focus solely on writing code.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, I didn&#39;t have to spend very long looking.  All it took was moving
300 miles away from everything I had ever known, with a wife and our 2 children 
in tow.  An easy decision for me, and since I&#39;m a pretty good salesman as well,
they followed with little resistance.</p>
<p>I accepted a position as an RPG IV programmer (because that&#39;s still where my
only real professional experience lie) and learned what it meant to do real
programming work for a real product that was to be purchased by real customers.
And I hated it.  It was boring.</p></p>
