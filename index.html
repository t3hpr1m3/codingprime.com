          <p><p>My most recent career stop was also my longest.  With the collapse of my startup dreams,</p>
<p>I had to find employment back in the real world.  I took a position with a local company
that wrote Credit Union software in Delphi (basically Pascal).  The only Delphi I had
ever used was in writing <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">InnoSetup</a> scripts,
so I really had no idea what to expect.  Thankfully, I found out my first day that:</p>
<ol>
<li>They had some server components written in C++, and</li>
<li>They also had a &quot;web&quot; department, which allegedly did internet stuff.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather than summarize what I actually DID during my time there, I&#39;ll instead
highlight some of the issues I encountered, my attempts to solve their problems,
and the ultimate reason for my departure.  I won&#39;t address the fact they were
still using Microsoft&#39;s Visual SourceSafe for version control.  I think it speaks for
itself.</p></p>

          <p><p>Recapping the <a href="../evolution-of-a-dev-part-2">last chapter</a>, I&#39;m managing a dev team,
doing a fair bit of C and Java development mixed with some TCL and the occasional
RPG IV.  I&#39;ve gained a bit of arrogance, but also quite a bit of real-world
development experience.  Technically, I&#39;m doing fairly well.  I&#39;ve also been able
to develop some fairly decent team management skills.  Unfortunately, I still 
have a problem with authority.</p>
<p>During a management meeting, I had a difference of opinion (fairly loudly and colorfully)
with the president of the company, and it was decided (surprise!) that my services were no
longer needed.  By this time, I had moved home and been telecommuting for over 2 years,
so logistically this wasn&#39;t as big of a blow as it could have been (thankfully).  This
was, however, the first time I had been unemployeed since I got my first job almost 8 years
prior.</p></p>

          <p><p>When we <a href="evolution-of-a-dev-part-1/">last left</a> our hero (me), he was basking
in the wonderment that is pure software development.  &quot;I wanna go do this fo realz!&quot;
So I set about finding a new job, one that would allow me to throw off the shackles
of ops and focus solely on writing code.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, I didn&#39;t have to spend very long looking.  All it took was moving
300 miles away from everything I had ever known, with a wife and our 2 children 
in tow.  An easy decision for me, and since I&#39;m a pretty good salesman as well,
they followed with little resistance.</p>
<p>I accepted a position as an RPG IV programmer (because that&#39;s still where my
only real professional experience lie) and learned what it meant to do real
programming work for a real product that was to be purchased by real customers.
And I hated it.  It was boring.</p></p>

          <p><p>I am a career developer.  That makes me extremely lucky, since I get to earn
a living doing the kind of things I&#39;d be doing anyway.   Basically, I have
the coolest hobby in the world, and I get paid for it.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve changed jobs many, many times in my career, and it&#39;s hardly ever been for
the same reasons.  Sometimes (usually), there has been an increase in salary
involved.  Others, it was an opportunity to move into a different environment,
be that technology used, ethos, or a new role to try out.  A few times, it
wasn&#39;t even a choice (early termination due to philosophical differences would
be a kind way of putting it).</p>
<p>Tomorrow, a new challenge awaits, in a new place, with a lot of new faces.
Starting a new job always triggers a bit of reflection (probably because
the process involves reviewing your resume), and this time is no exception.
I know I&#39;m not unique, but that&#39;s kind of the point.  I&#39;ve been around a lot
of devs throughout the course of my career, and (for the most part) it&#39;s fairly
easy to tell where they are in their evolution.</p></p>

          <p><p>My day job consists of architecting and maintaining several Rails
applications.  Some of these must deal with custom data sources that
were architected before there were standards for inter-application
communication (SOAP, REST, XML-RPC, etc).  One in particular is is a custom TCP
server that responds to method calls (using XML as the transport mechanism).
Replacing the service is not an option (as is usually the case with any
